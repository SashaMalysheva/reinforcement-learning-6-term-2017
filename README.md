1. Implementation of  Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ with prioritized sweeping to this domain, 
and compare the learning speed to Q learning. 

2. Implementation of domain stochastic in the following way: each movement action 
has 70% chance of success. With 30% probability, the lion will move in 
the opposite direction. Repeat the above exercise on this domain.
